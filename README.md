# R User Group #TidyTuesday Challenge
This is my repo for #TidyTuesday Challenge, where we will make data 
visualizations using R and share them in our meetings.
 
## What is #TidyTuesday?
- We’re doing a #TidyTuesday Challenge for the R User Group, where we’re making
  data visualizations and sharing for our July meeting.
- The wider R community participates in #TidyTuesday on a weekly basis. 
  Every Tuesday, a new dataset is posted on GitHub for anyone to explore,
